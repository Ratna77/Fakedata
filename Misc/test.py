"Dear Craig,

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        # Write the non-repeating column values to one sheet and the repeating rows to another sheet in a new
# Get the non-repeating column values based on the second column
non_repeating = df.drop_duplicates(subset=df.columns[1], keep=False)

# Get the repeating rows based on the second column
repeating = df[df.duplicated(subset=df.columns[1], keep=False)]

# Write the non-repeating column values to one sheet and the repeating rows to another sheet in a new Excel file
with pd.ExcelWriter('output_file.xlsx') as writer:
    non_repeating.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Non-Repeating Column Values', index=False, header=df.columns)
    repeating.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Repeating Rows', index=False, header=df.columns)

# Delete the file1_file2_diff.xlsx file
    os.remove(f'{file1_name}_{file2_name}_diff.xlsx')
